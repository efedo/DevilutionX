 * @brief Base struct for all in-world actors (players, monsters, and towners).
 *
 * Contains fields that are shared by all actor types:
 *  - animInfo:     Current animation state used for rendering.
 *  - direction:    The direction the actor is currently facing.
 *  - lightId:      Index into the lighting system (-1 if not emitting light).
 *  - hitPoints:    Current hit points (fixed-point, lower 6 bits are fractional).
 *  - maxHitPoints: Maximum hit points (fixed-point).
 *
 * Towners do not participate in combat so their hitPoints/maxHitPoints/lightId
 * will always remain at their default values (0 / 0 / -1).
 *
 * Position is intentionally omitted from this base because Player and Monster use
 * ActorPosition (which carries future/last/old/temp tile positions for animation
 * interpolation) while Towner uses a plain Point. Subclasses expose position
 * through their own appropriately-typed fields.
